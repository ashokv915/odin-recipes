        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The preferred meal of Charlie Kelly, from "It's Always Sunny in Philidelphia".
            <p>
                Only the finest cuts of beef should be used, and is delicious when served immediately,
                or after fermenting in the trash for a week.
